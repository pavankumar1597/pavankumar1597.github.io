## Projects :

## File-Concert ( May 2021 - Present ) (Spring boot - MicroService - Angular )

- The role included design, test-driven development, deployment using Spring Boot Security, and post deployment monitoring.
- Integrated payment gateway, OpenSource (Collabora) for document editing via sockets, TUS.io library for chunking files, and Rocket-Chat API for chat features were all used.
- Upload and download files from an S3 bucket (MINIO) and produce thumbnail images with multiple dimensions using Image Processing.
- Developed more than 290 APIs for complete applications, as well as several Front End API integrations in Angular  and Optimized several APIs that cause long response times.
- Ldap Auth and File versioning were added, among other modifications.
- Monitored with ELK log metrics after being deployed in Docker using CICD

## Kyc-Fusion ( Spring Boot | MicroServices | BPMN | Kafka ) (Sep 22 - Present )

- The role included design, development using Spring Boot Security , deployment in Docker.
- Used Open Source Camunda WorkFlow Engine for task management  assign task to agents

- Used Kafka Message Broker for Async Communication .

## WSO2 IAM ( Open Source ) ( Identity Server )  ( Jan 2021 - present )

- Worked on the Auth2, OIDC, and SAML2 protocols for integration with outside applications.
- This Authentication API handles more than 30k rpm and overrides custom authentication and custom multi-factor authentication for Identity Server end-to-end flow.
- calling an external microservice and encrypting and decrypting API payloads using the AES-256 algorithm with IV and salt on both the rest and soap services
- Deployed on an AWS EC2 cluster, in a Linux env, with log monitoring and metrics via ELK.
- doing POC on static OTP, SMS gateway, Auth2, and SAML2 successfully.

## CLIENT DIRECT FILE UPLOAD (Mar 2021 - April 2021) | Spring-Boot-Security (Full-Stack)

- Built a Client-Direct-File upload system based on a microservices architecture that would allow the front end to Upload files directly to S3.
- To upload files directly to the S3 private bucket, the user interface would request a unique S3 URL and temporary login details.

## Aadhar Vault (January 2021 - March 2021 ) | Spring-Boot-Angular (Full-Stack)

- I was in charge of the entire design, development, and deployment.
- Auto-generation of  Access keys (PKI) for each application.
- AES-256 encryption, IV, and Salt are used to decrypt Aadhaar Numbers that are stored in the Aadhar Vault db and map a special reference ID to access the original Aadhaar numbers.
- These APIs were able to handle more than 50k RPM.
- The Encrypting and decrypting payload Using a Public and Private key infrastructure.

## Video Kyc (Nov 2020 - Mar 2021)  | Spring-Boot-Security - Angularjs  (Full-Stack)
